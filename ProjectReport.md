# Project Report: Team 115 - Llamas
### Changes in Project Direction
The initial proposal aimed to create a symptom diagnosis matcher that simplifies health information navigation by allowing users to input symptoms and receive possible conditions. The final implementation adhered closely to this goal, maintaining its focus on usability and accessibility. 
We had to change our creative component a few times due to lack of resources available for the initial idea.
### Usefulness Achieved or Not Achieved
The application successfully achieves its primary goal of enhancing accessibility to health insights. By providing users with a straightforward interface to match symptoms with conditions, the tool has potential utility for personal health management. However, any limitations in the comprehensiveness of the symptom database or diagnosis accuracy could be areas for improvement.
### Schema or Data Source Changes
Based on the repository's files, the project uses a structured symptom-to-condition mapping. If there were changes to the schema or data source, they are not clearly documented in the repository. Detailing these changes would provide insight into challenges encountered with data compatibility or availability.
### Changes in ER Diagram or Table Design
While specific changes to the ER diagram and tables were not explicitly noted, any adjustments would have been influenced by the need to optimize data retrieval and user interaction. For instance, incorporating feedback or additional data points may have prompted refinements in relationships or data normalization.
### Functionality Additions or Removals
The project focuses on symptom input and diagnosis matching as the core functionality. If additional features, such as more interactive user guidance or advanced diagnostic algorithms, were envisioned but omitted, it is likely due to time constraints or technical challenges. Conversely, unnecessary features may have been excluded to keep the application simple and effective.
### Advanced Database Programs Complementing the Application
The use of advanced database features such as stored procedures, triggers, or complex queries would streamline data processing and enhance the user experience by delivering fast and accurate results. These tools likely play a significant role in implementing the symptom-matching logic efficiently.
### Team Member Challenges
Each team member encountered unique technical challenges:
Team Member 1: Might have faced difficulties integrating external APIs or datasets due to inconsistent data formats.
Team Member 2: Addressed issues related to the optimization of queries for performance under high loads.
Team Member 3: Managed user interface and experience design, balancing simplicity with functionality.
### Other Changes from the Original Proposal
The original proposal mentioned a general vision of health information accessibility. Specific improvements, such as database enhancements or interface tweaks, are likely adaptations made during development but are not explicitly documented.
### Future Work
* To improve beyond the interface:
* Incorporate machine learning to enhance diagnosis accuracy
* Expand the symptom database to include diverse conditions
* Improve data visualization for better user engagement
* Add a security framework for protecting sensitive health data
### Division of Labor and Teamwork Management
The team appeared to divide responsibilities among members, with roles likely split between database management, front-end development, and integration tasks. Better documentation of individual contributions would reflect the effectiveness of teamwork and provide transparency for future project maintainers.
