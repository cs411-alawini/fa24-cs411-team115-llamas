# Project Report: Team 115 - Llamas
### Changes in Project Direction
The initial proposal aimed to create a symptom diagnosis matcher that simplifies health information navigation by allowing users to input symptoms and receive possible conditions and medications. The final implementation adhered closely to this goal, maintaining its focus on usability and accessibility. 
### Usefulness Achieved or Not Achieved
The application successfully achieves its primary goal of enhancing accessibility to health insights. By providing users with a straightforward interface to match symptoms with conditions, the tool has potential utility for personal health management. However, any limitations in the comprehensiveness of the symptom database or diagnosis accuracy could be areas for improvement.
### Schema or Data Source Changes
Our project uses a structured symptom-to-condition mapping. We had to change the source of our user data. Once we started loading in the data into the GCP, we realized that the data from the online dataset was not compatible with our database design, so we used Chat-GPT, as advised by our TA, to generate fake user data to input into the Patient and MedicalProfile tables.
### Changes in UML Diagram and Table Design
The [database design](doc/PT1_Stage2_3NF_Normalized_UML_(Updated).pdf) we submitted during Stage 2 demonstrated a very elementary understanding of our backend. We did not have clarity on how the database should be structured, and we had lots of weak entities and unnecessary tables. During Stage 3, we fixed our [database design](doc/UpdatedDatabaseDesign.md). This new table design has fewer entities and corrected relations.
### Functionality Additions or Removals
The project focuses on symptom input and diagnosis and medication matching as the core functionality. Our original idea, as illustrated in the [project proposal](doc/ProjectProposal.md), had the user manually check the symptoms they had from a provided list on the user interface. The original sketch of our web app in the project proposal defined the creative component as using OpenAI to generate a treatment plan based off of the diagnosis, but after receiving feedback from our TA, we changed the creative component to integrate a GPT-like functionality using OpenAI API to convert the user's free-response input into a list of symptoms that match the existing symptoms in the database. However, in the process of working towards this component, we realized that the OpenAI API is not free, so we used the BERT API instead. Although BERT is still an advanced model, it requires a lot more training than what we had the time for; therefore, our accuracy in our results is low.
### Advanced Database Programs Complementing the Application
The use of advanced database features such as triggers and transactions in our system significantly streamlines data processing and enhances the overall user experience by ensuring fast and accurate results. Triggers are employed to automatically enforce critical constraints, such as preventing duplicate usernames during user submissions, which maintains data integrity without requiring additional application-level checks. Transactions, on the other hand, ensure that complex operations, such as checking for medication-allergy conflicts or generating diagnostic insights based on user submissions, are executed atomically and consistently. These features reduce the likelihood of errors, improve system reliability, and enable real-time feedback for users. By automating these essential processes within the database layer, we optimize performance and provide users with a seamless experience, allowing them to receive precise recommendations and relevant warnings without unnecessary delays.
### Team Member Challenges-
Linnea: Encountered challenges while loading datasets into the database due to inconsistent formats. She performed data exploration in Python, using techniques like data cleaning, transformation, and mapping to reformat rows and ensure compatibility with the database schema. 
Kinjal: Faced challenges with the creative component, as the BERT model often produced inaccurate results when processing users' free-response queries. Although the model employed natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract medical symptoms from colloquial language and match them to database entries, inconsistencies in phrasing and limited training data led to mismatches, impacting the system's accuracy.
Manasi: Struggled with designing complex queries for Stage 4 Checkpoint 2 that aligned with the database schema. Limited time for testing made it challenging to ensure that these queries didnâ€™t affect the front-end performance or cause crashes during user interaction.
### Other Changes from the Original Proposal
The original proposal mentioned a general vision of health information accessibility. Specific improvements, such as database enhancements or interface tweaks, are likely adaptations made during development but are not explicitly documented.
### Future Work
* Improve interface aesthetically
* Further training the BERT model using NLP techniques and other tools to enhance symptom matching accuracy
* Expand the symptom database to include diverse conditions
* Improve data visualizations for better user engagement
### Division of Labor and Teamwork Management
The team worked together on all components until Stage 3. The team then divided responsibilities among members, with Linnea on database management, Kinjal on front-end development, and Manasi on integration tasks.
