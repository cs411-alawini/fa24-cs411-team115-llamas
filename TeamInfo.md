## Project Summary 
Navigating health information can be overwhelming, especially when self-diagnosing. Our symptom diagnosis matcher simplifies this by allowing users to input symptoms and receive a list of possible conditions. With a user-friendly interface, individuals can quickly interpret their symptoms and gain insights into potential illnesses. This knowledge will provide increased accessibility and will empower users to make informed decisions about seeking medical advice or exploring over the counter treatments. Ultimately, we want to help bridge the gap between scattered information and health insights.
